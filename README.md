# Project Overview

KejaPrime is a web-based platform designed to help users in Kenya find rental houses within specific locations. The app allows users to search for available homes or rental properties near their current residence or in other desired areas. By offering an intuitive and interactive user experience, the platform enables house hunters to locate properties that match their preferences, including price, size, and amenities.
The platform utilizes geolocation services and filtering options to provide users with the most relevant listings based on their location and preferences. Property owners can list their available houses, providing essential details such as pricing, location, photos, and contact information for potential tenants. In turn, renters can explore these listings, communicate directly with property owners, and arrange viewings or rental agreements.
